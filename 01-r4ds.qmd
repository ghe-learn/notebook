# Background

This notebook was created for students to work through the [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). A minimal suggested structure is outlined below, but can be deleted and restructured. This first code-chunk below loads the `tidyverse` R Package, which is used through out the book. Additionally required packages can be added here.

```{r}
